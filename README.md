## üë®‚Äçüéì **Research Interests**

- **Low-resource NLP & AI** 
  - Bridging the "digital divide" for the **7,000+ languages**, of which only **100** have AI support
  - Focus on **multilingual representation learning** and use of **prior knowledge/external information**
  - Exploring **data augmentation** strategies to improve model performance
  - Statistical perspective: how can we analyze model limitations and improve low-resource performance?
- **Morphological Generalization** 
  - Investigating LLMs (Large Language Models) capabilities in morphology
  - Evaluating compositional generalization in diverse linguistic contexts
- **Model Evaluation & Resource Creation:** 
  - Development of high-quality evaluation sets for **low-resource languages**
  - Creating **ParaNames**, a multilingual entity name corpus for 400+ languages

## üõ†Ô∏è **Workshops Organized**

- Fourth Workshop on Multilingual Representation Learning (EMNLP 2024)
- First Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Turkic Languages (ACL 2024)
- DCLRL Workshop on Dataset Creation for Lower-Resourced Languages (LREC 2022)
- CoCo4MT Shared Task on Corpus Construction for Machine Translation (MTSummit 2023)
